Watts
-----

So, your coach has you using TrainingPeaks to manage your workouts. You've had a long day at work. You're getting ready to do your routine, but are dreading navigating through the confusing TrainingPeaks website to find today's regimen.

Enter Watts. Watts tells you what your prescribed workout is for the day and nothing else. It's displayed with simplicity and readability in mind, so you can get the information you need and get out.

If you have a coach, or use TrainingPeaks, Watts is the app for you.
